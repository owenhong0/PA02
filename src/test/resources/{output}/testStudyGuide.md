# Vectors

## Declaring a vector
 - General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();
 - type needs to be a valid reference type

## Adding an element to a vector
 - v.add(object of type);


# Java Arrays
 - An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type


# Loops
 - Loops act like **recursion** but in a simpler form

## Types of Loops

### Declaring each type of Loop
 - General Form: for(iterating variable; iterating range; update iterator){ body }
 - General Form: while (some condition is true) { body }

#### Applications
 - Loops are very useful when implemented with **ArrayLists**


# Conditional Statements
 - Conditional statemens, or **if-else** statements serve as a tool to compare expressions in code

## Types of Conditional Statements

 - if statements
 - else if statements
